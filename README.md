# Knowledge-in-Supervised-Learning

This is the main code repository for the Van Der Schaar Lab reruitment task.

## Abstract:
We investigate the integration of expert knowledge into machine learning models, focusing on supervised learning settings, using simple and intuitive forms such as natural language. Building on the work of **informed meta-learning**, which demonstrated how inductive biases can be implicitly learned in meta-learning, we aim to extend these ideas to the supervised learning paradigm, the paradigm that has demonstrated the highest potential in solving Machine Learning tasks.
